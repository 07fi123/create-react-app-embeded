# Embeded-react-scripts

This package includes scripts and configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  Specifically modified for use in a SPIFFS filesystem on a ESP8266.

To configure a new create react app project with this configuration 

```
npx create-react-app my-app --scripts-version embedded-react-scripts
```



This has been tested and built using [platform.io](https://platform.io) on a NodeMCU board. 

If your curious on how to serve this once built checkout the [ESPAysncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer) project. 

If your new to react please refer to the react standard documentation:
